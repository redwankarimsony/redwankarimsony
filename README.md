# ML Competitions on [HackerEarth](https://www.hackerearth.com/challenges/)

The following table contains all the code bases of the competitions that I participated on HackerEarth. The original repository is uploaded in my GitHub account in their respective repos. However, for easier browse through specific problem and solutions, this table may come handy to you. Keep Learning!

**\* Note:**  `If you can't find the GitHub Repo of the solution, it means that the competition is live, hence the repo is private for now. Once the contest is over, I will make that repo public.` 



# ML Competitions on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)

The following table contains all the code bases of the competitions that I participated on Kaggle. Most of the solution are done through kaggle kernel. In order to view the live original notebook with dataset loaded, follow the **kaggle live link** for respective notebooks in the github repos.  However, a copy of them are uploaded in their respective github repos. For easier browse through specific problem and solutions, this table may come handy to you. Keep Learning!

|  1. | [Object-Detection-and-Segmentation-with-TorchVision](https://github.com/redwankarimsony/Object-Detection-and-Segmentation-with-TorchVision)|   For this tutorial, I have finetuned a pre-trained Mask R-CNN model in the Penn-Fudan Database for Pedestrian Detection and Segmentation. It contains 170 images with 345 instances of pedestrians, and later on it will use it to illustrate how to use the new features in torchvision in order to train an instance segmentation model on a custom dataset. | Detection and Segmentation |
